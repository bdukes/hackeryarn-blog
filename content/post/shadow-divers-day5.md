# Crazy Deep

The divers forgot their limit on a deep dive. They became caught up in the excitement and push further than they ever have.

It can be healthy to push yourself, but you need to know your limits. You don't want to be too uncomfortable in a situation. Neither do you want to repeatedly push yourself further than you have gone before.

Feldman learned this lesson the hard way by going on the deepest dive he's ever attempted two times in a row.
