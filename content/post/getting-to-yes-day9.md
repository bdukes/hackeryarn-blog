# Conclusion on negotiation

In every negotiation you should address emotions, strive to understand the
other side, and use facts instead of emotions. This gives you more than an
argument. You will be able to get a better outcome in any situation,
even with people who are the complete opposites of you.

Always prepare yourself for a negotiation. Present strong reasoning for your
arguments and counter with facts. Enrich the information you
already have by asking questions, so your position grows stronger even in
disagreement.

Finally, always come into a negotiation expecting to influence the outcome. No
matter how little power you have, show that you care. You will both get better
results by working together. Don't claim defeat before you try.
