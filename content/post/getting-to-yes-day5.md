# Insist on Using Objective Criteria

Don't take offers at face value. Try to figure out the objective reasoning
behind the offer. Just asking about the reasoning makes the other person
evaluate their position. Once they are in an evaluation mode, it opens up the
floor for you to present your reasoning.

With all the reasoning is on the table, insist on a fair process. Be ready
to compromise between two equally worthy criteria. And be ready to walk away if
the other party isn't willing to compromise. Keeping a reputation as
a principled negotiator will server you well in the long run.
