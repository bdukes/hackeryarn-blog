# Invent Options for Mutual Gain

You can't settle on a good outcome without having the right ideas. Separate
your brainstorming from the decision process. Ban judgment and
throw out the craziest ideas you can. Then use those ideas as launchpads for
refinement.

Try to understand why everyone came up with different ideas. Use these differences
in values, believes, and interests to settle on an outcome. You can't reach an
agreement without differences. Ebay wouldn't exist if everyone thought their
old junk was worth the same amount. The only reason Ebay works is because
people have different values.

Finally use all this information to make the decision easy. There is value for
sides in every negotiation. Don't make the situation worse than where you
started. And Give them a choice they can just say yes to.
