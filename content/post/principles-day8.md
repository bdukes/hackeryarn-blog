Pain is the best teacher. By being uncomfortable and failing, you are given
opportunities to grow. We don't see these situation as opportunities
because we only evaluate the first level consequences.

Like working out, the first level consequence is the pain and struggle you
feel while working out, but if you look a little further down the line there
are many benefits. You will feel better, live longer, and look better. This
situation repeats itself throughout your life. By making a sacrifice now, you gain
multiple befits in the future.
