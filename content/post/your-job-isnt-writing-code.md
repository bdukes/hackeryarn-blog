# Your Job Isn't Writing Code

Every line of code you write is a liability. That line of code you just wrote
adds complexity to your code base, gives you more nuances to remember, it
might even be a bug. If code is so expensive and dangerous. What can you do?
After all, you are a developer.

The answer. You must remember your real job. Delivering value to the users.

Users don't care what your class hierarchy looks like. They don't care which
language or framework you're using. They don't even care if your system is a
cloud ready microservice. The only thing the user cares about is that your
product helping them.

## Reminders for Delivering Value

You can ensure you are delivery value by remembering these principles.

### The Why is More Important Than the How

We became developers because we are problem solvers. When a user comes with a
suggestion. We jump to the *how* of what they are asking for. Never taking the
time to understand *why* they are asking for this feature.

This leads us to deliver exactly what the user wanted. Just to leave them
disappointed in the result, and our hard work getting little use.

It is crucial to apply our problem solving skills in the right place. We need to
understand what the real problem is. Then work with the users to come up with a
better solution than anything we could come up with alone.

### Strive for the Simplest Solution First

When we start on a project. We think of the perfect solution. We create our own
requirements. We dream up scalability, robustnest, the perfect UI.

The user just wants to get rid of the spreadsheet that's driving their department
insane. Turns out they only have 20 users and don't care about the UI at all.

We need to focus on solutions that are delivering at the
scale of the problem. Not stroking our egos by doing what Facebook does to
support billions of users that we don't have.

### Deliver Something Tomorrow

We all had projects that weeks after the famous kickoff meeting we finally start
work. Question come up like "What are we building again?". "Did we really agree
to have this feature?". "Why is this feature even included?"

Don't wait until you forget everything about the project to get started on it.
The best time to get started is right after deciding what the
project is. That's when all the details are fresh, creative juices are
flowing, and we are excited about the solution.

We need to use this time of heightened productivity to deliver something. Then
show it. It will be rough. But the users gets to see our passion for the
project. The users gets to give us feedback. The users start to trust
us to deliver. By showing something early, we won trust to last the entire project.

### Everything is Code

When we get started on projects there is a desire to nail down details. We come
up with requirements. Then we come up with diagrams. Then we come up with an
over all design. Then we start work and everything we came up with becomes
instantly outdated or a huge burden to maintain.

The problem is. The documentation and diagram we just created bares the same
expenses as code. What happens if we forget to update our documentation? Well,
your documentation is now lying to you. Documentation that lies
will make your code harder to maintain not easier.

There are 2 kinds of documentation that we should have. Documentation that is
automatically generated and documentation that explaining the why(mainly for
that weird bug we found last week with a solution that makes no sense).
Everything else is too expensive. Unless we are creating a library, where
documentation is as important as the code.

## Final Thoughts

Every developer faces these pitfalls. No developer will deliver the perfect
solution. However, with a few reminders we can get that much closer to the
solution.
