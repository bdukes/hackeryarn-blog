# Your Job isn't Writing Code

Every line of code you write is a liability. That line of code you just wrote
added complexity to the code base, gave you more nuances to remember, it
might even be a bug. After that warning, you might be asking "If code is so
expensive and dangerous but can I do?" After all, you are a developer.

The answer. You must remember your job. Delivering value to your users.

Users don't care what your class hierarchy looks like. They don't care that
you are using the latest language or framework. They don't even care if you're
in the cloud. The only thing the user cares about is that your product works
well.

## Reminders for Delivering Value

You can ensure you are delivery value, and not being a yes man, by remembering
these principles.

### The Why is More Important Than the What

We became developers because we are problem solvers. Our natural tendency is
to find the problem and solve it, many times with the wrong solution. Not
because we don't care or we came up with wrong solution. But because we don't
take the time to figure out the real problem.

### Strive for the Simplest Solution First

When we start on a project. We think of the perfect solution. We create our own
requirements. We dream up scalability, robustnest, the perfect UI.

The user just wants to get rid of the spreadsheet that's driving the department
insane. Turns out they will only have 20 users and it's only used internally so
UI doesn't matter.

We need to focus on solutions that are delivering at the
scale of the problem. Not stroking our egos by doing what Facebook does to
support billions of users that we don't have.

### Deliver Something Tomorrow

The best time to get started on the project is right after deciding what the
project is. That's when all the details are fresh, creative juices are
flowing, and we are excited about the solution.

We need to use this time of heightened productivity to deliver something. Try no
knock out a rough demo of what the implementation looks like. Then show it. It
will be rough, we might not have the ability to deploy it. But the users gets to
see your passion. The user gets to give you feedback. The user starts to trust
you to deliver.

The trust is the most important thing we win from an early demo. Because the
user saw what we can do. The project is now real to everyone. They know it's not
on the bottom of your to-do list. Now if you hit a delay, at least you showed
progress and everyone can see the work that's coming.

### Everything that supports your project is code

Everyone thinks that if they document their code and create diagrams for how
their code works. Then they will be able to maintain it easily.

The problem is. That documentation or diagram you just created bares the same
expenses as code. What if you forget to update that doc string or your service
diagram? Well, your documentation is lying to you know. Documentation that lies
will make your code harder to maintain not easier.

There are 2 kinds of documentation that you should have. Documentation that is
automatically generated and explaining the why(mainly for that weird bug you found last week with a
solution that makes no sense). Everything else bares as steep of a cost as the
line of code you just wrote. Unless you are creating a library, where you should
treat your documentation with the same importance as code, don't bother with
extra documentation.

## Final Thoughts

Every developer faces these pitfalls. No developer will deliver the perfect
solution. However, with a few reminders in had we can get that much closer to
the solution.
