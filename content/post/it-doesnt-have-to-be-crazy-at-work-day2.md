# Your words carry more power than you think

> "1 percent occasions like that shouldn't drive policy 99 percent of the time."

Chances are, you have someone looking up to you or you are an officially a leader. This comes with great responsibility.

Be careful with the example that you set and what you give you attention to. Staying up late, responding to emails on the weekends, and looking at thing "just in case" all serve to create a bad culture around you.

You must keep your priorities in check if you want to create a great work environment.
