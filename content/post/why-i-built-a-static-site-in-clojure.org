* Why I Built a Static Site in Clojure
I haven't built a purely static site in nearly a decade. But a friend asked me
to create a site for his new restaurant. And I couldn't let him spend money on
another atrocity.


** Wordpress my Old Friend

Searching for themes. Setting up a Wordpress server. Building out managed
content. Turns out, I forgot the effort of build a Wordpress site.
