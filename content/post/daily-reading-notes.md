Recently I ran an experiment of posting daily reading notes on this blog. This
was very much a personal experiment.

Making these posts every day reinforced my reading habit. I felt motivated to
set aside time to read, and I got the chance to reflect on my reading. It
also provided the opportunity to share more with others.

I plan on keeping this habit going, but this blog isn't the right place for it.
I want to keep this blog dedicated to tech posts. So I decided to
create a dedicated site for my [daily reading notes](dailyreadingnotes.com).

If you liked the daily reading notes posts, I hope you enjoy the new site. If
you were here for the tech posts, I hope keeping this blog dedicated to
a single topic makes it easier to sort through.
