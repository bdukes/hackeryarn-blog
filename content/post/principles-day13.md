There are undeniable correlations between life and work. Both are built on
relationships, both are driven and improved by the people you surround
yourself with.

Many of the things people pursue are a byproduct of the people an culture they
create around them. If money is your goal, you will never make much by
just chasing money. The way to make money is to become excellent and valuable
at what you do. Then learn to market it and work with others to become even
better.

So be tough on the people in your life and hold each other to a high
standard, but balance out the toughness with love and care. Those
people are the foundation for your future.
