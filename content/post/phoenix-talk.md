I recently gave a talk, at the local [Fullstack Meetup](http://www.fullstack.org/), on the [Phoenix Framework](http://www.phoenixframework.org/). Phoenix is the de
facto web framework for [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/).

In this talk, I cover some of the best features of [Phoenix](http://www.phoenixframework.org/):

-   [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/): The platmor which Elixir and Phoenix are build on. (albeit
    very brief overview of the major features)
-   [Plug](https://github.com/elixir-lang/plug): The specification for composable module design that gives
    Phoenix much of it's power.
-   [Ecto](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.html): The database integration layer.

Close to the end, there is a short demo of an app showing how a typical Phoenix
app looks. In this portion, I also use [Visualixir](https://github.com/koudelka/visualixir) to demonstrate the process layout of the app and how comunication is handled between processes.
