# Focus on Interest not Positions

Negotiations start because both parties have an interest. They use their
interests to develop a position. Conflict arises because each parties
sees their position as the only way to succeed. And bot parties end up upset
with each other or losing out on a lot of what they wanted.

That entire situation can be avoided. Don't come up with your position before
you talk to the other person. Don't assume you know what they want out of the
negotiation. Don't dismiss their concerns.

Take the time to hear them out. Really listen and ask why. Explain the your
issues while being supportive to the other side. Lay out all your interests.

Once all the information is on the table, you can work as a team.
