If you want to be successful, you need to leverage everything around you. Your
intuition, technology, and the knowledge of others melded together. With more
input you can make better decision.

However, no matter how much input you get, remember to not get greedy. When you
want ever more and get out of balance you run the risk of losing more than you
can handle. Instead, make intelligent adjustment. You will still have a huge
upside but with the assurance that you won't lose it all.
