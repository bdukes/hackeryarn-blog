# A Shape of Power

The divers were ecstatic to find a mysterious u-boat where no u-boat should have been. They dove in ready to take full advantage of they 25 minutes they had to look at the submarine. Everyone explored a different part and grew more excited with each new discovery.

Once the expedition was over, everyone handled the secret of the u-boat differently. Some dove into research, some couldn't resist telling a friend, and others visited submarines at a museum.

Remember, everyone reacts differently to the same circumstance. Don't expect another person to handles a situation how you would. Prepare yourself the worst, because others may even break a promise they proposed.
