# History Mauled

Chatterton and Kohler finally found the identity of the sub. To achieve this,
they had to go against historical books. They read the actual communications
and proved even the experts wrong.

As said by Mark Twain: "Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority,
it is time to pause and reflect." Question the common wisdom if things don't
line up. History books have been rewritten. Scientists actively work to prove
each other wrong. Why wouldn't you question everything.

The worst thing that could happen is you will gain a deeper understanding of
why things are the way they are.
