# None of us is coming back
The command and first officer couldn't be more different in their leadership
style.

The commander treated every situation with the utmost professionalism. He won
the man's trust through his discipline.

The first officer was the complete opposite. He was friendly and open with the
men. The whole crew became his friends. They laughed and joked around every time
they were off duty.

Despite these differences, they both respected each other. Each one was
meticulous when it came to their work and held themselves to a high standard.
They even refused the potential to abandon their post because of a shared sense
of duty.

Much like Kohler and Chatterton; they were polar opposites on the surface but
shared a passion and moral code that tied them together.
