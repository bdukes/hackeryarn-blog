# Nothing at That Location
Chatterton approaches research and diving the same way. He gets the big picture
first. Scanning at the highest and safest level. Building a game plan and
gathering valuable information.

Once he finds something promising, he dives in as deep as possible. Gleaning
everything he can from the best opportunity the situation presents to him.

This is a great way to approach your problem. Spend some time upfront making
sure you are tackling the right problem. Then dig into it no matter
how difficult it seems.
